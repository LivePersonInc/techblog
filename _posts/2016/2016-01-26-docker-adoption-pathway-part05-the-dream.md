"But I wanted to run it locally!, But I wanted to run that server locally!".  I woke up last night sweating to my own screams after haivng this terrible nightmare.  It started with a stnadard guy at a cool conference with a tshirt with nice wording of "build once run anywhere!", Hey don't i know you from somewhere? No, I don't think so he replied.  I'm sure I do, let me think, yes! I replied "Write once run anywhere" isn't that you! no he replied, but do you have a problem with my tshirt? actually yes I replied.  You see, this evening I was trying to run the docker image I was building on my laptop and it didn't run, didn't it suppose to run anywhere this including my own laptop? yeah he replied.  you know what, I know someone, we can call him, I'm sure he can tell you whats wrong.  OK I said, he typed in his phone "docker" and dialed, you know docker? I i mean, the docker!? I asked, yes.  But - isn't he a daemon or something? arent' you afraid of calling him? no he is really a nice guy, i'm sure he can help.  Hey Docker? whats up? you see i'm on this nice conference and there is a cool guy here who says his image won't run on his own laptop.  yeah, yeah, let me ask him, do you use any orchestration tool? yeah I replied, for which he continued discussing it with docker, ehhm, ehhm and then back to me - which orchestration tool do you use? kuberentes I replied, ehhm, ehhm, he won't talk to you.  What?! he said he is working right now on docker compose and he won't talk to a competing orchestration tool.  For which I replied, tell him that if he is truely OCI compliant he is obliged by moral to be spken and speak to other orchestration tool.  OK he will, he gave me the phone.  Hey docker, listen, my build did not run locally.  What was the problem exactly docker asked?
